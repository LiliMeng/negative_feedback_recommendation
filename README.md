### Cross-Entropy Loss and Negative-Valued Label Weights

The **cross-entropy loss** for a single instance can be expressed as:

$L_i = -\log(p(y_i | s_i))$

Where:
- $p(y_i | s_i)$ is the predicted probability of the correct label $y_i $ given the input $s_i $.
- $L_i$ measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution.

### Incorporating Negative-Valued Label Weights

If we use **negative-valued label weights** for certain items to penalize recommending "unwanted" items, the loss function becomes:

$L_i = w_i \cdot (-\log(p(y_i | s_i)))$

Where:
- $w_i$ is the label weight, which could be **negative** for unwanted items.
- A negative $w_i$ inverts the penalty: instead of minimizing $L_i$, the system tries to **maximize** $ p(y_i | s_i) $, reducing the likelihood of these items being recommended.

### Gradient Blow-Up Issue

#### Gradients of Cross-Entropy Loss:
The gradient of $L_i$ with respect to the model's output (logit) $z_i$ is:

$\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial z_i} = w_i \cdot \frac{\partial (-\log(p(y_i | s_i)))}{\partial z_i} = w_i \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p(y_i | s_i)} \cdot \frac{\partial p(y_i | s_i)}{\partial z_i}\right)$

When $p(y_i | s_i)$ to 0, the term $\frac{1}{p(y_i | s_i)}$ approaches infinity. This leads to:

- **Large gradient values** (gradient blow-up), which destabilize training, especially with **negative weights** where the penalty inversion amplifies this effect.
- The gradient magnitude becomes disproportionately large for low-probability unwanted items, which can overwhelm updates to the model and make optimization difficult.

---

### Intuition Behind the Problem

For **unwanted items**:
- A **negative weight** $w_i$ inverts the goal, making the model try to **maximize** $p(y_i | s_i)$ for those items.
- If $p(y_i | s_i)$ is already close to 0 (very unlikely), the gradient signal becomes excessively large due to $-\log(p(y_i | s_i)) \to \infty$.
- The optimizer takes excessively large steps, causing instability and poor convergence.

### Possible Solutions

To avoid gradient blow-up while discouraging unwanted items, consider these alternatives:

#### 1. **Clip Gradients**
   - Apply gradient clipping to cap the maximum gradient magnitude during backpropagation.

#### 2. **Smooth the Logarithm**
   - Use a smoothed version of cross-entropy loss to prevent the log function from exploding:
    $L_i = w_i \cdot (-\log(p(y_i | s_i) + \epsilon))$
    
     Where $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant.

#### 3. **Limit Negative Weights**
   - Instead of making weights strongly negative, limit their range to a less extreme value to avoid excessively penalizing unwanted items.

#### 4. **Regularize Probabilities**
   - Add a regularization term to push $p(y_i | s_i)$ for unwanted items closer to 0 without explicitly penalizing them with extreme loss terms.

#### 5. **Alternative Loss Functions**
   - Consider alternative losses like focal loss, which down-weighs the contribution of low-probability instances:
     $L_i = -w_i \cdot (1 - p(y_i | s_i))^\gamma \cdot \log(p(y_i | s_i))$
     This focuses learning on more confident predictions.

### Conclusion

Using negative-valued weights in cross-entropy loss can effectively penalize unwanted items, but the gradient blow-up issue arises when probabilities approach zero. This can be mitigated by smoothing the loss, clipping gradients, or adopting alternative loss functions. Careful tuning is required to balance penalization while maintaining stable training.
